# Solution Overview
The Photo search on AWS solution helps you build an application that organizes and search for images.

This solution comes with a web interface that you can expand and customize easily. So by deploying this solution, you are able to develop a photo organizing application quickly and easily.

Please refer to [Implementation Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/solutions/latest/photo-search-on-aws/welcome.html) for the detail of this solution.

# AWS Solutions Constructs
[AWS CDK Solutions Constructs](https://aws.amazon.com/solutions/constructs/) make it easier to consistently create well-architected applications. All AWS Solutions Constructs are reviewed by AWS and use best practices established by the AWS Well-Architected Framework. This solution uses the following AWS CDK Constructs:

-   aws-apigateway-lambda
-   aws-cloudfront-s3
-   aws-s3-lambda


<a name="customizing-the-solution"></a>
# Customizing the Solution
The solution can be deployed through the CloudFormation templates available on the solution home page: Photo Search on AWS. To make changes to the solution, using the below steps download or clone this repo, update the source code and then run the deployment/build-s3-dist.sh script to deploy the updated codes to an Amazon S3 bucket in your account.

<a name="prerequisites-for-customization"></a>
## Prerequisites for Customization
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [AWS Configuration and credential file settings](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-files.html)
- [AWS CLI version 2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html)


<a name="build"></a>
## Build
### Configure the bucket name of your target Amazon S3 distribution bucket
```
export DIST_OUTPUT_BUCKET=my-dist-bucket-name
export SOLUTION_NAME=photo-search-on-aws
export VERSION=my-version
export TEMPLATE_OUTPUT_BUCKET=my-template-bucket-name
export REGION=my-region
```
<!-- - Parameter details -->
|Parameter|Description|
|- |- |
|DIST_OUTPUT_BUCKET|This is the global name of the distribution. For the bucket name, the AWS Region is added to the global name (example: 'my-bucket-name-us-east-1') to create a regional bucket. The lambda artifact should be uploaded to the regional buckets for the CloudFormation template to pick it up for deployment.|
|SOLUTION_NAME|The name of This solution (example: photo-search-on-aws)|
|VERSION|The version number of the change|
|TEMPLATE_OUTPUT_BUCKET|The name of the S3 bucket where the CloudFormation templates should be uploaded|
|||


### Create a regional bucket and a global bucket.
```
aws s3 create-bucket --bucket $DIST_OUTPUT_BUCKET-$REGION
aws s3 create-bucket --bucket $TEMPLATE_OUTPUT_BUCKET
```
- When creating and using buckets it is recommeded to:
  - Use randomized names or uuid as part of your bucket naming strategy.
  - Ensure buckets are not public.
  - Verify bucket ownership prior to uploading templates or code artifacts.

### Now build the distributable:
```
cd <rootDir>/deployment
chmod +x ./build-s3-dist.sh
./build-s3-dist.sh $DIST_OUTPUT_BUCKET $SOLUTION_NAME $VERSION $TEMPLATE_OUTPUT_BUCKET
```

<a name="unit-test"></a>
## Unit Test
```
cd <rootDir>/source
chmod +x ./run-all-tests.sh
./run-all-tests.sh
```

<a name="deploy"></a>
## Deploy
### Deploy artifacts
Deploy the distributable to an Amazon S3 bucket in your account. Note: you must have the AWS Command Line Interface installed.
```
aws s3 cp ./global-s3-assets/ s3://$TEMPLATE_OUTPUT_BUCKET/$SOLUTION_NAME/$VERSION/ --recursive --acl bucket-owner-full-control
aws s3 cp ./regional-s3-assets/ s3://$DIST_OUTPUT_BUCKET-$REGION/$SOLUTION_NAME/$VERSION/ --recursive --acl bucket-owner-full-control
```

### Deploy with CloudFormation
- Navigate to [CloudFormation](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?#/stacks/create/template).
- Use the template generated in $TEMPLATE_OUTPUT_BUCKET
